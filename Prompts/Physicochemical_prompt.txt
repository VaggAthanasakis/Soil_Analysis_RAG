Physicochemical properties : 
    Identify and List each element (pH, Elect. Conduction, Organic Matter, Caco3,Active CaCo3), including its measured value and unit in the format: Element: Value (Unit).
    The output must be a python dictionary. 

Example output format:
{   
    "pH": "value" ,
    "Electric. Conductance": "value Î¼S/cm",
    "Organic Matter": "value %" ,
    "Caco3": "value % Volumetically",
    "Active CaCo3": "value % CC C2O4 (NH4)2"
}

* You MUST find the values of all the above elements 
* The outputed dictionary must have ONLY these 5 key-value pairs


Instructions:
You must not create an intro or outro, just give the dictionary ONLY.
DO Not use the above values, it is just an example format.
