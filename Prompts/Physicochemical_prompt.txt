Physicochemical properties : 
    Identify and List each element (pH, Elect. Conduction, Organic Matter, Caco3,Active CaCo3), including its measured value, unit and measurement method in the format: Element: Value (Unit) method.
    The output must be a python dictionary. 

Example output format:
{   
    "pH": "value method" ,
    "Electric. Conductance": "value Î¼S/cm method",
    "Organic Matter": "value % method" ,
    "Caco3": "value % method",
    "Active CaCo3": "value % method"
}

* You MUST find the values of all the above elements 
* The outputed dictionary must have ONLY these 5 key-value pairs
* If a parameter is not present, replace its value strictly with null in order to produce valid json

Instructions:
You must not create an intro or outro, just give the dictionary ONLY.
DO Not use the above values, it is just an example format.
If you dont find the method. replace 'method' with 'null' (example: "Caco3": "value % null")
