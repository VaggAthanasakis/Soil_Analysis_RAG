Îœechanical soil structure : 
    Identify and List each one of the elements: (Sand), (Silt), (Clay) in the basic soil analysis along with its measured value,unit and measurement method. 
    Evaluation, from the basic soil analysis, extract the Evaluation of the soil. This should be one word ("Clayey" or "Sandy" or "Calcareous" or "Muddy" or something else).
The output must be a python dictionary. 
Example output format:
{   
    "Sand": "value %",
    "Silt": "value %",
    "Clay": "value % method",
    "Evaluation" : "x"
}

* You MUST find the values of all the above elements 
* The outputed dictionary must have ONLY these 4 key-value pairs
* If a parameter is not present, replace its value strictly with null in order to produce valid json

Instructions:
You must not create an intro or outro, just give the dictionary ONLY.
DO Not use the above values, it is just an example format.
If you dont find the method. replace 'method' with 'null' (example: "Clay": "value % null")
