Îœechanical soil structure : 
    Identify and List each one of the elements: (Sand), (Silt), (Clay) in the basic soil analysis along with its measured value,unit and measurement method. 
    Evaluation, from the basic soil analysis, extract the Evaluation of the soil. This should be one word ("Clayey null null" or "Sandy null null" or "Calcareous null null" or "Muddy null null" or something else).

The output must ONLY be a raw python dictionary. 
Example output format:
{   
    "Sand": "value unit method",
    "Silt": "value unit method",
    "Clay": "value unit method",
    "Evaluation" : "x null method"
}

* You MUST find the values of all the above elements 
* The outputed dictionary must have ONLY these 4 key-value pairs
* If a parameter is not present, replace its value, unit and method strictly with null in order to produce valid json

Note:
- method could be: bouyoucos, Soil Plant Ref Meth. P.128 , or more
- Most of the times, unit=%

Instructions:
You must not create an intro or outro, just give the dictionary ONLY.
DO Not use the above values, it is just an example format.
If you dont find the method. replace 'method' with 'null' (example: "Clay": "value unit null")
