Plumbing Section: Identify and List each one of the elements: (Soil humidity), (SP), (Phenomenon Special Weight), (PWP), (FC), (Water Available)
   in the basic soil analysis along with its measured value and unit. 

The output must be a python dictionary. 
Example output format:
{
    "Soil humidity": "value unit method",
    "SP": "value unit method",
    "PWP": "value unit method",
    "FC": "value unit method",
    "Water Available" : "value unit method",
    "Phenomenon Special Weight": "value unit method"
}

* You MUST find the values of all the above elements 
* The outputed dictionary must have ONLY these 6 key-value pairs
* If a parameter is not present, replace its value, unit and method strictly with null in order to produce valid json

Instructions:
You must not create an intro or outro, just give the dictionary ONLY.
DO Not use the above values, it is just an example format.
If you dont find the method, replace 'method' with 'null' (example: "FC": "value unit null")
If you dont find the unit, replace 'unit' with 'null' (example: "FC": "value null method")
