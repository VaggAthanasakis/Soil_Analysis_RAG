REQUIREMENTS OF CULTURE IN GOOD & CLIMATE

Cotton is a plant with great adaptability and can be cultivated in a wide variety of soils. High yields are achieved in average mechanical composition, deep fertile soils with adequate drainage with good waterproofing and organic substance <3.0%. Light soils require increased amounts of fertilizers while the heavy soils that cause suffocation and diseases in the root system and are unsuccessful for cultivation. It shows good tolerance to soil nalas. In terms of southwest, it grows at a large wide pH from 5.5 to 8.0, a mild from 6.8-7.3. Is a plant of warm climates, with the most high temperatures at high temperatures in the period of growth and

 of fruiting. During sowing, the minimum temperature grounds for good growth and germination in space is 13 ° C, while the excellent temperature
 Environment for rapid growth and high yields are 32 ° C - 34 ° C


BASIC PRINCIPLES


Basic Lipping (in sowing): It is sought to meet all the needs of nutrients necessary for good plant installation, the
 Creating a rich root system and early and Euroste growth. In the basic lipping granted all the quantity is granted
 of phosphorus (the lack phosphorus in the early stages of cultivation is not then corrected), all the amount of potassium and up to the
 50% of the amount of nitrogen (the use of ammonium fertilizers, slow release fertilizers).


Surface Lipping (Before Tahtenia): Surface Lipasis is sought to meet all the needs of nutrients necessary for the
 Development of summer vegetation, flowering and fruiting, as well as the growth of walnuts. It is recommended to be applied by
the onset of the appearance of the lines until the start of flowering in a single (with stabilized forms of ammonium nitrogen) or more
doses (via hydrolysis with nitrogen nitrate). The remaining amount of nitrogen (50%) is administered.

Irrigation

According to the analysis data, the ground at 0-30 cm weighs 381.56 tonnes.

The maximum amount of water that can hold the soil is: 125.11 m. the acre

The active depth of root of crop where the main mass of plant roots develops and the Lord occurs
Provision of water roots are: 65 - 130 cm.

The total requirements of cotton in water are on average around 700km per acre per year. From germination to appearance of comb

Suggested Method of Irrigation: Staggan

TRAFFIC TRAINING

Soil machinery should be done when its moisture varies to 50-60% of its water capacity.

LIGHT APPLICATION DIRECTIONS

- Applying basic lubrication, in winter:
Here is the corrected text:


Do not do in frost periods.

- The application of surface lubrication in the summer should not be heat.

- For the proper application of hydrolysis the fertilizer is pumped into the middle third "set" of the irritation (if you have planned 12 -hour irrigation, open the water from 4th to 8th hour)

- Fully spraying non-coarse items can be combined with a dilute urea solution (0.2-0.3%) For better penetration inside the leaves as well as by neutralizing the free acidity of the solution with a hydrated solution. In the event that you only prepare the micronutrients, use only chelating forms and not sulfuric forms. The solutions should be prepared immediately before application. It is recommended before each use.

- For the application of follicular fertilizers:

- Do not be heat and the spray solution should bathe the leaf on both sides.
- spray in cold and wet periods of the 24 hours (at night or early
Here is the corrected text with spaces inserted between Words:


In the morning).

- Never spray stressed plants.
- Do not spray when the trees or crop are in malaise or a more general weakness.
- Special care should be paid to the pH of the spray fluid ranges between 5.5 and 6.5.

- application must be evenly, covering the foliage as much as possible on both sides
- The effectiveness of lubrication usually increases when the fertilizer is administered in many small doses, with the maximum amount administered during the period of greater need for cultivation. Irrigation can also contribute to frequent and small doses.

The fertilizers proposed relate to basic types on the market rather than products of specific companies.
