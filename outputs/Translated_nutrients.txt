AGROECO 240437 Duma 3d. OBSERVATIONS & COMMENTS
It is proposed not to install plants that require acidic soil eg. Raspberries, bilberry etc
It is recommended not to install plants that are not favored by high calcium carbonate (CACO3)
After periods of stressed plants due to low temperatures, dried, quartz, etc. It is recommended to use biodegradation in the stage
of the formation of scallops and during the flowering. Dosage 0.3L the acre with a quantity of spraying more than 20 l per acre
REQUIREMENTS OF CULTURE IN GOOD & CLIMATE
Tobacco -gambled mounted mackerel
Middle mechanical composition, deep fertile soils with adequate good water and organic substance <3.0%. In the light territories
requires increased amounts of fertilizers while heavy soils cause suffocation and diseases in the root system and are
inappropriately cultivation.

Irrigation
According to the analysis data, the ground at 0-30 cm weighs 381.56 tonnes
The maximum amount of water that can hold the soil is: 125.11 m. the acre
The active depth of root of crop where the main mass of plant roots develops and the Lord occurs
Provision of water roots are: 65 - 130 cm.
The total requirements of cotton in water are on average around 700km per acre per year. From germination to appearance of comb
Suggested Method of Irrigation: Staggan
TRAFFIC TRAINING
Soil machinery should be done when its moisture varies to 50-60% of its water capacity.
LIGHT APPLICATION DIRECTIONS
- The application of basic lubrication, during the winter, does not take place in frost.
- The application of surface lubrication in the summer should not be heat.
- For proper application of hydrolyzing the fertilizer is mounted in the middle third "set" of the ignore (if you have planned 12 -hour irrigation
open the waterproofing from 4th to 8th hour)
- Oyegulical tears of vigilants are confused (0.2-0.3%)
leaf -free leafy -liberal release.
Micronutrients, use only chelating forms and not sulfate forms. Solutions should be prepared immediately before
application. It is recommended before each use.
- For the application of follicular fertilizers:
- Do not be heat and the spray solution should bathe the leaf on both sides.
- Spray on cold and wet periods of the 24 hours (at night or early in the morning).
- Never spray stressed plants.
- Do not spray when the trees or crop are in malaise or a more general weakness.
- special attention must be given to the pH of spray fluid ranges between 5.5 and 6.5`
- application must be evenly, covering the foliage as much as possible on both sides
- Effectiveness of the efficiency of the ravine,
